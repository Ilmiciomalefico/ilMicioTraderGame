**ilMicioTraderGame** is a high-performance, open-source BTC Futures simulator. It transforms the often-intimidating world of crypto trading into a fast-paced, visual experience. Instead of just staring at static candles, you track the **Micio Rider** across real-time price action and professional-grade RSI heatmaps.

## 🌟 Concept
The mission is to provide an educational gateway into high-leverage trading. **ilMicioTrader** bridges the gap between gaming and financial analysis. Watch Micio's mood change based on your P/L: from the ecstatic **🤑 Giga-Micio** during pumps to the panicked **🙀 REKT-Micio** during liquidations.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Live Market Engine:** Powered by a direct WebSocket connection to **Bitget Public API** (BTC/USDT).
* **Professional RSI Logic:** Real-time **RSI (14)** calculation with a built-in 14-candle countdown for mathematical accuracy.
* **Visual Heatmaps:** High-visibility "Overbought" (70-100% Red) and "Oversold" (0-30% Green) zones for instant trend recognition.
* **Adrenaline HUD:** Features a dynamic **Tunnel Effect** that accelerates during active trades and a **Screen Shake** mechanic when losses exceed safety thresholds.
* **Bilingual Support:** Fully localized in **English** and **Slovenian**.

## 🎮 How to Play
1.  **Select Your Language:** Choose between EN/SL on the start screen.
2.  **Wait for Connection:** The RSI requires 14 minutes of data to be 100% accurate. You can track the progress in the RSI section (e.g., "PREPARING 5/14").
3.  **Set Your Strategy:** Adjust your **Leverage (Lev)** and **Position Size (Lot)**.
4.  **Execute:**
    * **LONG:** Bet on the price going up (Neon Green).
    * **SHORT:** Bet on the price going down (Red).
    * **EXIT:** Close your position and realize your P/L.
5.  **Survive:** If your balance hits $0, you will be **REKT** and must restart.

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer (The Paw-Print)
**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:**
* **NO REAL MONEY:** This application is a **SIMULATOR**. All funds ($10,000 starting balance) are **VIRTUAL** (toy tokens). There is no way to deposit, withdraw, or earn real currency.
* **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE:** The indicators (RSI, Price Action) are for educational and entertainment purposes only. 
* **HIGH RISK:** High leverage is extremely dangerous in real markets. This game is designed to show how quickly a balance can reach zero. 
* **DATA ACCURACY:** While we use real-time data, network latency may occur. Do not use this app to make real-world trading decisions.
